# EN0609-BeatMyBot

In the Specialist Games Programming module at university I was tasked to create a state machine that controlled a team of bots that would play a domination type game against some provided AI. This involved creating behaviours to be controlled by the state machine. The networking section of the assignment was to create a server and a client, where the client would get the data from the server and show this on the client side. This was improved from sending the entire class object over (which was what we were told to do) to sending select data over to save network traffic.
